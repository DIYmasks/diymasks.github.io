### Full disclosure

The WHO seems to be still advising against use of masks for the general healthy population (see, e.g.: [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/face-masks-cannot-stop-healthy-people-getting-covid-19-says-who)).

> Heymann said masks could create a false sense of security that could end up putting people at greater risk. Even with the mouth and nose fully covered, the virus can still enter through the eyes.

It's interesting that at the same time they recommend it for those more at risk:

> “It would be helpful if high-risk people – elderly, people with chronic conditions – wear a face mask if they can’t avoid crowed areas, because these people have the highest risk of severe outcomes such as ICU/death if infected,” she said.

Their mixed message, we understand, is because of a mix of the following reasons:
- wearing a mask does not give full protection and can give a false sense of security
- people wearing a mask need to learn to use it properly to maximise its effectiveness
- commercially available masks should be left for frontline health workers, and the market would not be able to provide enough for the general population

To which our answer is:
- use masks *in addition to* social distancing, frequent handwashing and do not take any risks
- learn how to use masks properly
- make your own masks
