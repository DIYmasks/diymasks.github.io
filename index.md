Everyone can do their part in preventing the spread of Covid-19. We made some masks in our house and distributed them to our neighbours.

There are some important things you need to do now, and for the foreseeable future, in order to limit the chance of you getting infected, or infecting others. These are listed here in rough order of importance:

- stay away from other people. This reduces the risk of getting in touch with someone who is sick, putting you at risk of contracting the disease, and reduces the risk that you, who may have been infected, in turn spread the disease to others.
- wash your hands frequently with soap and water. The virus can get into you through your mouth, nose and eyes. This can happen because you are in close contact with someone who is sick, who directly passes it on to you, or it could be because you touch with your hands a surface contaminated with the virus. In the latter case, if you touch your face/nose/mouth/eyes with your hand, you have a high chance of being infected. Washing your hands removes the virus from your hands and reduces the chances it may enter your body.
- if your hands have touched a contaminated surface, they will contaminate everything you touch (e.g.: your phone, house keys, payment cards, pockets). Be mindful of that and avoid touching anything that is not essential, and try not to touch personal objects with the same hand you used to, e.g.: open the door to a shop.
- if you really have to be in contact with other people (e.g.: going to work or shopping), then you can wear a face masks that covers nose and mouth. This heavily reduces the amount of virus-containing particles that can spread from the respiratory system of an infected person. It also reduces the chances that healthy subjects contract the virus, as droplets expelled by sick people would have a harder time reaching their mouth and eyes. Remember: **wearing a face mask is not an iron-clad. You still need to stay as far as possible from other people, wash your hands, and use the mask properly in order for it to protect others and you**.

## Summary of our view on the current face masks situation

There is a global shortage of off-the-shelf, certified face masks and respirators, and as such they should be reserved for healthcare workers and people with symptoms. If you are not in one of these categories, you probably don't need such a mask. You can make your own at home, see some resources below. Notice that the requirements for healthcare workers are different from that of general population: healthcare workers have to protect themselves from being in close contact with infected people, whereas members of the general population have to protect others from the infection they may be carrying. As a member of the general population, you have to consider that you may be knowingly or unknowningly infected, and you can prevent the spread of the virus to others by, besides staying away from other people, wearing a face mask. The mask will reduce the amount of infected particles that you will release in the environment around you.

## How to use a face mask properly

The key points are:

- it should cover your **nose** and **mouth**
- your hands should be clean when you put it on and remove it (remember: your hands need to be clean to touch your face)
- you should prevent the outside of the mask from touching your face (remember: if the mask prevented any infected droplets from getting into your mouth/nose, they will be right there *on the mask*. You don't want to rub them on your face)
- different type of masks have different durability.

Our take: the genearl public should use a mask every time you get out of the house, and within the house if someone you live with is infected.

Our take: depending on the type of mask, you may not need to discard it. You can store it in a safe place (e.g.: a plastic bag) for 4 days before taking it out and letting it dry.

> Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.

> The evidence so far is that the novel coronavirus spreads in respiratory droplets - spatters of liquid expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even speaks. These droplets are usually heavy enough to fall immediately to the ground or surrounding surfaces. Transmission can occur if the droplets reach the mouth, nose or eye of someone nearby, either directly or from an unwashed hand that’s touched a contaminated object or surface. When an infected person wears a face cover, the droplets can be caught by the mask rather than being expelled. In theory, wearing a face covering could also help protect people who are uninfected, if it stops them from touching their face. However, according to the WHO, there is currently "no evidence" that public mask wearing by healthy people prevents infection with respiratory viruses such as the one that causes Covid-19.

> Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).
> If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.

## FAQ

### Why do you do this? Do you want my money?

No. We are trying to be useful.

### Are you a doctor?

We are a doctor of philosophy and an aspiring doctor of phylosophy. No medical doctors here.

### Full disclosure

The WHO seems to be still advising against use of masks for the general healthy population (see, e.g.: [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/face-masks-cannot-stop-healthy-people-getting-covid-19-says-who)).

> Heymann said masks could create a false sense of security that could end up putting people at greater risk. Even with the mouth and nose fully covered, the virus can still enter through the eyes.

It's interesting that at the same time they recommend it for those more at risk:

> “It would be helpful if high-risk people – elderly, people with chronic conditions – wear a face mask if they can’t avoid crowed areas, because these people have the highest risk of severe outcomes such as ICU/death if infected,” she said.

Their mixed message, we understand, is because of a mix of the following reasons:
- wearing a mask does not give full protection and can give a false sense of security
- people wearing a mask need to learn to use it properly to maximise its effectiveness
- commercially available masks should be left for frontline health workers, and the market would not be able to provide enough for the general population

To which our answer is:
- use masks *in addition to* social distancing, frequent handwashing and do not take any risks
- learn how to use masks properly
- make your own masks
